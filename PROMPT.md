# THIS SESSION

0a. Study @SPECS.md thoroughly
0b. Study @implementation_plan.md carefully
0c. Because the Phases in @implementation_plan.md are sequential, it's important to do them in order
0d. Think about the most important thing to implement from @implementation_plan and how to break it down into tasks
0e. Pick one task to implement. Execute a handoff when the task is done: update SPECS.md and stop the session
0f. A file is finished when i) it has total type coverage, ii) there are zero errors and warnings, and iii) QA is done.
0g. Don't start new files if there are unfinished files.
0h. Don't start new apps/modules if there are unfinished apps/modules.
0i. If you finish a file in your session, use /commit
0j. QA feedback should usually be implemented
0k. If all four phases are marked as complete in SPECS.md, you are already done and can stop your session early.

# Updating SPECS.md:

1a. Use DRY documentation in SPECS.md
1b. Keep track of files and their error counts
1c. Keep track of progress on each file
1d. Record type design best practices you learn

# Getting feedback

2a. Run type checking with uv
2a. Write an unbiased unit test to verify behavior.
