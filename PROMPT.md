# THIS SESSION

0a. Study @SPECS.md thoroughly
0b. Study @implementation_plan.md carefully
0c. Think about the most important thing to implement from @implementation_plan and how to break it down into tasks
0d. Pick one task to implement. Execute a handoff when the task is done: update SPECS.md and stop the session
0e. A file is finished when i) it has total type coverage, ii) there are zero errors and warnings, and iii) QA is done.
0f. Don't start new files if there are unfinished files.
0g. Don't start new apps/modules if there are unfinished apps/modules.
0h. If you finish a file in your session, use /commit

1b. Keep track of files and their error counts
1c. Keep track of progress on each file
1d. Record type design best practices you learn
