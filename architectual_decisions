Assessment: Architectural Decisions & Task Scoping

Based on my review, this project has strong documentation but there are areas that could use more definition before implementation begins.

What's Well-Defined
-------------------

Task Scoping — Excellent. The 6-phase breakdown in SPECS.md is clear:
- Each phase has explicit deliverables (e.g., discretizer.py, feature_builder.py)
- Success criteria are specified
- Logical sequencing with dependencies understood

Model Architecture — Good initial constraints:
- Transformer structure with multi-horizon heads is clearly diagrammed
- Size bounds specified (128-256 embedding dim, 2-4 layers)
- Latency requirement locked (<10ms inference)

Directory Structure — Comprehensive planned layout in place

Gaps & Ambiguities
------------------

1. Unresolved Open Questions — 11 questions listed but not answered:
   - Single vs multi-asset model?
   - Causal vs bidirectional attention?
   - Target GPU specs?
   - These should be decided before Phase 4 begins

2. No Decision Engine Interface — The downstream consumer of predictions is undefined. What format does it expect? What's the contract?

3. Discretization Strategy Not Locked — "Start with 101 buckets" is a suggestion. Should be a firm decision with rationale documented.

4. Agent Definitions Incomplete — Only 3 of 6 agents defined (cuda-optimizer, streaming-integrator, evaluator are placeholders)

5. No pyproject.toml — Dependencies aren't specified yet (PyTorch version, CUDA requirements, etc.)

Recommendations
---------------

Priority | Action
---------|-------
High     | Resolve data questions (symbol list, timestamp alignment) in Phase 1 before proceeding
High     | Lock discretization strategy (bucket count, width approach) at end of Phase 2
Medium   | Define decision engine interface before streaming integration work
Medium   | Specify target GPU and CUDA version constraints
Low      | Complete remaining agent definitions when those phases approach

The architecture is well-thought-out for a spec-first project. The main risk is carrying forward ambiguity — I'd recommend treating the "Open Questions" section as a checklist to resolve during the relevant phases rather than deferring them all.
